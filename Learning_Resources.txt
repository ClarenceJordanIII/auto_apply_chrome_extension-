# Learning Resources - From Developer to Software Engineer

## ðŸŽ¯ Main Goal: Implement Algorithms from Mathematical Formulas
Current Gap: Can conceptualize S(Q,A) = Î£(Wi Ã— Mi) + B(Q,A) + C(Q) but struggle to translate into complete working code

## ðŸ“š CORE ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (Foundation)
- "Introduction to Algorithms" by CLRS - The bible for understanding how to implement algorithms from mathematical descriptions
- "Algorithm Design Manual" by Skiena - More practical, shows you how to go from problem â†’ algorithm â†’ code
- LeetCode/HackerRank - Practice implementing algorithms by hand daily

### 2. Mathematical Programming (Formula â†’ Code Translation)
- "Concrete Mathematics" by Knuth - How to translate mathematical notation into code
- "Programming Pearls" by Bentley - Real-world algorithm implementation
- Khan Academy Linear Algebra - Understanding vector operations for NLP similarity

### 3. String Algorithms (For NLP Work)
- "Algorithms on Strings, Trees, and Sequences" by Gusfield - Deep dive into string matching, edit distance, etc.
- Coursera "Algorithms on Strings" - Hands-on implementation practice

## ðŸ”¥ HANDS-ON PRACTICE (MOST IMPORTANT)

### Daily Coding Challenges:
Implement one algorithm per day from scratch:
- Day 1: Levenshtein distance (edit distance)
- Day 2: Jaccard similarity 
- Day 3: Hash table implementation
- Day 4: Trie data structure
- Day 5: Dynamic programming solution

### Project-Based Learning:
- Build a search engine from scratch - Teaches indexing, similarity, ranking
- Implement your own database - B-trees, sorting, indexing
- Create a compiler - Parsing, tokenization, syntax trees

## ðŸ“š SPECIFIC TO CHROME EXTENSION

### NLP & Text Processing:
- "Speech and Language Processing" by Jurafsky - Chapters on similarity, tokenization
- "Natural Language Processing with Python" - Hands-on NLP implementation
- Stanford CS224N lectures (free on YouTube) - Modern NLP techniques

### System Design & Architecture:
- "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Kleppmann - How to build scalable systems
- "System Design Interview" books - Real-world engineering problems

## ðŸŽ¯ 8-WEEK ACTION PLAN

### Week 1-2: Core Algorithms
- Implement Levenshtein distance from scratch
- Build a hash table without using built-in objects
- Code quicksort and mergesort by hand

### Week 3-4: String Algorithms
- Implement Jaccard similarity formula by hand
- Build a trie for efficient string matching
- Code Boyer-Moore string search

### Week 5-6: Chrome Extension Algorithms
- Rewrite calculateScore function from mathematical notation
- Implement semantic similarity without libraries
- Build your own tokenization algorithm

### Week 7-8: Data Structures
- Implement a balanced binary tree
- Build your own graph algorithms (DFS, BFS)
- Code dynamic programming solutions

## ðŸš€ THE BRIDGE: Mathematical Formula â†’ Working Code

Practice this exact translation daily:

Formula: S(Q,A) = Î£(Wi Ã— Mi) + B(Q,A) + C(Q)

Step 1: Break down the math
- Î£ = summation (for loop)
- Wi = weight at index i
- Mi = match score at index i
- B(Q,A) = bonus function
- C(Q) = coherence function

Step 2: Implement each piece
```javascript
function calculateScore(question, answer, weights) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
        sum += weights[i] * getMatchScore(i);
    }
    return sum + getBonusScore(question, answer) + getCoherence(question);
}
```

## ðŸ’¡ KEY INSIGHT
You already have the engineering mindset (you designed that formula!). 
You just need to build the implementation muscle memory. 
Focus on translating mathematical concepts into code daily.

The fact that you can create formulas like S(Q,A) = Î£(Wi Ã— Mi) + B(Q,A) + C(Q) 
shows you're already thinking like an engineer - you just need the coding 
fluency to match your algorithmic thinking!

## ðŸŽ¯ DAILY PRACTICE ROUTINE

1. Morning: Read 1 algorithm explanation
2. Afternoon: Implement it from scratch (no looking at solutions)
3. Evening: Optimize and understand time/space complexity
4. Weekend: Build a small project using that week's algorithms

## ðŸ“ˆ PROGRESS MILESTONES

Week 2: Can implement basic sorting algorithms from memory
Week 4: Can build string matching algorithms from mathematical descriptions
Week 6: Can translate any mathematical formula into working code
Week 8: Can design and implement complex data structures from scratch

Remember: The gap between developer and engineer is the ability to implement 
algorithms from first principles, not just use existing libraries!
