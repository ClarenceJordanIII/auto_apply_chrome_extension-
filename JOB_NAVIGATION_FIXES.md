# ðŸ”§ Fixed: Job Navigation & Redeclaration Issues

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. âœ… **Redeclaration Error Fixed**
**Problem**: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'currentDomain' has already been declared`
**Solution**: Added proper conditional declaration checks like we did for ALLOWED_DOMAINS

### 2. âœ… **Jobs Going to Search Page Instead of Completing**
**Problem**: Some jobs were opening search pages instead of the actual job application pages
**Root Causes & Solutions**:

#### **A. Too Restrictive Automation Check**
- **Problem**: `shouldRunAutomation()` function only allowed very specific URL patterns
- **Solution**: Expanded allowed URL patterns to include:
  - `/jobs/` (in addition to `/jobs?`)
  - `smartapply.indeed.com`
  - `form/profile`
  - `apply/resume`
  - `/apply`
  - `indeed.com/m/jobs` (mobile)
  - Pages with application form elements

#### **B. Invalid Job URLs**
- **Problem**: Some job URLs were relative or malformed, causing navigation to wrong pages
- **Solution**: Added URL validation and fixing:
  ```javascript
  // Convert relative URLs to absolute
  if (jobLink.startsWith('/')) {
    jobLink = 'https://www.indeed.com' + jobLink;
  }
  
  // Ensure proper viewjob format
  if (!jobLink.includes('/viewjob?') && !jobLink.includes('/jobs/view/')) {
    if (jobId) {
      jobLink = `https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=${jobId}`;
    }
  }
  ```

## What This Fixes:

### âœ… **Proper Job Navigation**
- Jobs now open to correct application pages instead of search pages
- URLs are properly formatted and validated
- Fallback to construct proper viewjob URLs using job IDs

### âœ… **Broader Automation Support**
- Works on more types of Indeed job pages
- Supports mobile Indeed URLs
- Detects application forms more reliably

### âœ… **No More Syntax Errors**
- Fixed variable redeclaration conflicts
- Extension loads without errors on page refresh

## Test It:
1. **Load extension** in Chrome
2. **Go to Indeed job search** 
3. **Start automation** - should now properly navigate to job application pages
4. **Check console** - no more redeclaration errors

Your jobs should now complete properly instead of getting stuck on search pages! ðŸš€
