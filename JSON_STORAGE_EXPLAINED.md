# Chrome Extension File Storage Explanation 📁

## Your JSON File Storage Question

You asked: *"is my json file going to be stored along side the app when this is deployed or what"*

## How Chrome Extension Storage Works

### 1. **Extension Package Files** 📦
- Your `questions-config.json` file is included in the extension package 
- It gets installed with the extension when users install it
- Located in: `chrome-extension://[extension-id]/questions-config.json`
- **Read-only**: Users can't modify this file directly

### 2. **Runtime Data Storage** 💾
Your extension uses multiple storage methods:

#### Chrome Storage API (Primary)
```javascript
// Your extension saves data here:
chrome.storage.local.set({
  jobQueue: [],
  failedJobs: [],
  retryQueue: []
});
```
- **Location**: Chrome's internal database
- **Persistent**: Survives browser restarts
- **Private**: Only your extension can access it
- **Synced**: Can sync across user's Chrome browsers if using `chrome.storage.sync`

#### localStorage (Secondary/Fallback)
```javascript
// Fallback storage:
localStorage.setItem('questionsConfig_learnedData', data);
```
- **Location**: Browser's localStorage for the website domain
- **Persistent**: Survives page refreshes
- **Domain-specific**: Only available on Indeed pages

### 3. **File Locations When Deployed** 🚀

#### Development (Your Current Setup)
```
📁 Your Extension Folder/
├── 📄 manifest.json
├── 📄 background.js  
├── 📄 content.js
├── 📄 questions-config.json ← This gets packaged
└── 📄 other files...
```

#### Production (After Publishing)
```
📁 Chrome Extension Store Package/
├── 📄 All your files (including questions-config.json)
└── 📁 Gets installed to user's Chrome extension directory
```

#### User's Computer (After Installation)
```
📁 Chrome Extension Directory/
├── 📄 questions-config.json ← Read-only copy
└── 📁 Chrome Storage Database/ ← Runtime data stored here
    ├── jobQueue data
    ├── learned patterns  
    └── user settings
```

## What This Means for Your Extension

### ✅ **Good News**
1. **questions-config.json** will be included with your extension
2. **All job data** is stored in Chrome's secure storage
3. **Learned patterns** are saved and persist between uses
4. **No user files** are created on their desktop

### ⚠️ **Important Notes**
1. **Updates**: If you update questions-config.json, users need to update the extension
2. **Backup**: Users can't manually backup the learned data (it's in Chrome's database)
3. **Privacy**: All data stays local unless you add cloud sync features

### 🔧 **Current Storage Strategy**
Your extension intelligently uses:
- **questions-config.json**: Initial configuration and patterns
- **Chrome Storage**: Job queues, settings, and persistent data  
- **localStorage**: Temporary learned patterns and quick access data

## Deployment Checklist

When you publish your extension:
1. ✅ **questions-config.json** - Automatically included
2. ✅ **Storage permissions** - Already configured in manifest.json
3. ✅ **Data persistence** - Users' learned patterns will be saved
4. ✅ **Clean installs** - New users get fresh storage

Your JSON file setup is perfect for deployment! 🚀
